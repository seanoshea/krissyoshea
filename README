TODO:
Browser support, mobile edition (css media queries and 960)
Reintroduce krissytosi.css and figure out the app's styling guidelines.
Need moar images. Updated bio too.
Being sproutcore into the app.
Models for thumbnails, large images, slideshows.
Perhaps templating for the navigation.
Figure out how to do history management in the app.
